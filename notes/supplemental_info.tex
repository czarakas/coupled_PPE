\noindent\textbf{Text S3: Calculating emergent changes in land surface properties}
We calculated the emergent changes in $r_s$ and $r_a$ by inverting the equations for sensible heat flux and latent heat flux (L).  S=($\rho C_p (T_s-T_a))/r_a$  and L=($\rho \lambda(q^* (T_s)-q_a))/(r_a+r_s )$, where $\rho$ is the air density at the lowest atmospheric level, $T_a$ is the air temperature at the lowest atmospheric level, $q_a$ is the specific humidity at the lowest atmospheric level, $T_s$ is land surface skin temperature, and $q^* (T_s)$is the saturated specific humidity at $T_s$. $C_p$ and $\lambda$ are constants, the specific heat of X and the latent heat of vaporization, respectively. We verified our derived changes in $\alpha$, $r_s$, and $r_a$ by demonstrating that they yielded accurate reconstructions of temperature changes in the offline land-only PPE using the two-resistance method (TRM; Rigden and Li 2017), described in Supporting Information X.However, the TRM is ill-suited for attributing quantifying how muchthe  changes in $\alpha$, $r_s$, and $r_a$ drive coupled temperature changes to changes in $\alpha$, $r_s$, and $r_a$ because it combines all temperature changes from atmospheric feedbacks into one term (due to change in Ta), and cannot distinguish the extent to which Ta changes are driven by changes in $\alpha$, $r_s$, and $r_a$.
