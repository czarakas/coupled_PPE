# Methods

* Two-resistance Mechanism (TRM), Rigden and Li 2017
* Intrinsic biophysical mechanism (IBM) method, Lee et al., 2011
* Juang et al., 2007
* Luyssaert et al., 2014

The main issue with all of these methods is backing out the aerodynamic resistance from monthly averaged meteorological data.
