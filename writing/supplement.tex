\section{Model configuration and experimental design}
\label{Text:model_configuration}
CESM PPE simulations were run using the \href{https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/releases/tag/branch_tags\%2FPPE.n11_ctsm5.1.dev030}{\mintinline{Fortran}{branch_tags/PPE.n11_ctsm5.1.dev030}} tag for the Community Land Model version 5 \citep[CLM5;][]{lawrence_community_2019} and the \href{https://github.com/ESCOMP/CESM/releases/tag/cesm2.2.0}{\mintinline{Fortran}{cesm2.2.0}} tag for all other model components. The land was initialized with the spun-up land state from the default model parameterization which includes the carbon content of soil and vegetation pools. The coupled simulations use the Community Atmosphere Model 6 \citep[CAM6;][]{bogenschutz_path_2018}, and a slab ocean \citep{danabasoglu_equilibrium_2009} which is based on q-fluxes from preindustrial simulations of the full dynamic ocean model. We did not apply flux corrections, and note that the top of atmosphere energy imbalance is relatively small and changes minimally across the PPE (average=-0.157 W/m$^2$, $\sigma$=0.010 W/m$^2$; Figure S\ref{fig:supp_TOA_energy_balance}).

Each parameter perturbation simulation, which we refer to as an ensemble member, was run for 140 years under constant preindustrial greenhouse gas concentrations and land use conditions. The first 40 years were discarded as spin up, which is long enough for fast atmospheric processes, leaf area, soil moisture and temperature, and the surface ocean to largely equilibrate (Figure S\ref{fig:supp_spinup}).

\section{Parameter selection procedure}
\label{Text:parameter_selection}
We used two parameter selection criteria: (1) that parameters would likely have a large impact on the atmosphere, based on results from the CLM5 PPE, and (2) that parameters sampled different functional areas of the model. For our first criterion, we ranked all parameters based on multiple metrics of land-to-atmosphere fluxes (Table S\ref{table:metrics_of_impact}, Table S\ref{table:LH_example_rankings}), globally and for individual biomes, focusing on the quantities that the land model passes to the atmosphere model in CESM2 (Table S\ref{table:land2atm_fluxes}). We quantified parameters impact on individual biomes by classifying the land surface into the nine Whittaker biomes \citep{whittaker_communities_1975} and ice sheets based on each grid cell's mean precipitation and temperature. Out of 205 total parameters, we identified 40 parameters that appeared in the top five for more than five rankings. For our second criterion, we then grouped those top 40 parameters into functional categories, and we selected 18 parameters such that we did not sample more than four parameters from any given functional category. 

\section{Calculating the pattern of warming due to a doubling of CO$_2$}
\label{Text:doubling_CO2}
We calculated the pattern of warming due to a doubling of CO$_2$ from  two concentration-driven CESM2 simulations: one forced with preindustrial CO$_2$ concentrations of 284.7 ppm (1xCO$_2$) and one forced with a doubling of preindustrial CO$_2$, 569.4 ppm (2xCO$_2$). We ran simulations with an active land and atmosphere, and a slab ocean. We ran simulations for 120 years, and discarded the first 60 years as spin up. These CESM simulations were run using the \href{https://github.com/ESCOMP/CESM/releases/tag/cesm2_3_beta03}{\mintinline{Fortran}{cesm_2_3_beta03}} tag and \href{https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/releases/tag/branch_tags%2FPPE.n08_ctsm5.1.dev030}{\mintinline{Fortran}{branch_tags/PPE.n08_ctsm5.1.dev030}} tag for CTSM. Doubling CO$_2$ drove a 5.2°C global mean temperature increase (6.5°C global mean land temperature increase), consistent with CESM2's documented high equilibrium climate sensitivity (Gettelman et al. 2019).

\section{Disentangling drivers of land temperature and precipitation changes}
%Calculating emergent changes in land surface properties
\label{Text:land_surface properties}

We used multiple linear regression to disentangle the extent to which land precipitation ($P$) and temperature ($T_s$) changes across our coupled PPE are driven by three land surface properties: albedo ($\alpha$), evaporative fraction (EF), and a measure of aerodynamic coupling ($r_a$). First, we diagnosed $\alpha$, EF, and $r_a$ for each ensemble member of land-only PPE at each grid cell using monthly model output. We calculated $r_a$ by inverting the equation for sensible heat flux. We then use these derived changes in land-only $\alpha$, EF, $r_a$ as predictors in a multiple linear regression to predict coupled $T_s$ and P change at each point for each month. We used predictors from the land-only rather than the coupled PPE in order to remove the feedback between climate and land surface properties. In the coupled PPE, changes in land surface properties are due to both land parameter uncertainty and land responses to climate changes (e.g., precipitation changes can influence evaporative fraction), but changes in land surface properties in the land-only PPE isolate the influence of land parameter uncertainty on land surface fluxes. Because this grid cell level analysis does not account for remote or global-scale impacts of parameter perturbations, we also report results from regressions conducted using global averages. We do not perform regressions on global average land precipitation changes because the sign of precipitation changes are more regionally variable. 

We calculated the emergent changes in $r_s$ and $r_a$ by inverting the equations for sensible heat flux and latent heat flux (L).  S=($\rho C_p (T_s-T_a))/r_a$  and L=($\rho \lambda(q^* (T_s)-q_a))/(r_a+r_s )$, where $\rho$ is the air density at the lowest atmospheric level, $T_a$ is the air temperature at the lowest atmospheric level, $q_a$ is the specific humidity at the lowest atmospheric level, $T_s$ is land surface skin temperature, and $q^* (T_s)$is the saturated specific humidity at $T_s$. $C_p$ and $\lambda$ are constants, the specific heat capacity of dry air and the latent heat of vaporization, respectively. We verified our derived changes in $\alpha$, $r_s$, and $r_a$ by demonstrating that they yielded accurate reconstructions of temperature changes in the offline land-only PPE using the two-resistance method (TRM; Rigden and Li 2017). However, the TRM is ill-suited for attributing quantifying how much the changes in $\alpha$, $r_s$, and $r_a$ drive coupled temperature changes to changes in $\alpha$, $r_s$, and $r_a$ because it combines all temperature changes from atmospheric feedbacks into one term (due to change in the near-surface  air temperature $T_a$), and cannot distinguish the extent to which $T_a$ changes are driven by changes in $\alpha$, $r_s$, and $r_a$.
